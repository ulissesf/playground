# Ulisses' playground

* memlog - attempt to track GPU bound SMEM/LMEM using: 1. ebpf/bpftrace and i915 tracepoints and kprobes; 2. DRM fdinfo from i915/Xe drivers
* fforks.bt   - track a process and all its children using sched tracepoints in bpftrace/ebpf.
* lifetimes-rs - just playing with Rust and lifetimes.
* ioctls-rs - playing with ioctls in Rust.
